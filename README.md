# Matrix-Mixer rev.02 - IN PRODUCTION!

Welcome to the Matrix-Mixer wiki! Matrix mixer is a device that routes multiple input audio signals to multiple outputs.
It employs level controls to determine how much of each input is going to each output. The number of individual controls 
is the number of inputs witch is six multiplied by the number of outputs witch is six so (complex math) 36 controls.
It outputs mono, converts synth level signals to pro line level (+4dBu). LED`s for input clipping.
